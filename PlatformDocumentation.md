## 2. Getting Started

### 2.1 Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 20.x
- npm >= 10.x
- Docker Desktop (for local containerized backend)
- MongoDB Atlas account (or local MongoDB)
- Accounts at: Cloudinary, Resend, Groq, Stripe

### 2.2 Local Backend Setup

```bash
# 1. Navigate to backend
cd backend

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Create your .env file (copy from below and fill values)
cp .env.example .env

# 4. Start the development server (with hot reload)
npm run dev
# API running at: http://localhost:4000
# Health check:   http://localhost:4000/health
```

### 2.3 Local Frontend Setup

```bash
# 1. Navigate to project root
cd suntrix-ai-solutions

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Create .env.local
echo "VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4000/v1" > .env.local

# 4. Start development server
npm run dev
# Frontend running at: http://localhost:5173
```

### 2.4 First Admin Account Setup

The platform has no built-in default admin account (seed file removed). To create your first admin:

```bash
# In the backend directory, run directly via ts-node:
npx ts-node -e "
import 'dotenv/config';
import { connectDB } from './src/config/db';
import Admin from './src/models/Admin';
connectDB().then(async () => {
  await Admin.create({ email: 'admin@suntrix.com', password: 'your_secure_password', name: 'Admin', role: 'admin' });
  console.log('Admin created');
  process.exit(0);
});
"
```

Or use MongoDB Compass to insert directly into the `admins` collection.

### 2.5 Environment Variables Reference

## 3. System Architecture

### 3.1 Request Lifecycle

Every API request follows this exact path:

```
Browser/Client
    │
    ▼ HTTPS
Vercel Edge Network (Frontend)
    │  or  │
    │       ▼ /api calls
    │  Render (Backend API)
    │       │
    │       ├─ 1. Helmet (security headers)
    │       ├─ 2. CORS Check (allowed origins list)
    │       ├─ 3. Global Rate Limiter (500 req / 15 min)
    │       ├─ 4. Maintenance Mode Check
    │       ├─ 5. Stripe Webhook Raw Body Handler
    │       ├─ 6. express.json() Body Parser (10MB limit)
    │       ├─ 7. MongoDB Sanitizer (strips $ and . from inputs)
    │       ├─ 8. Morgan Logger
    │       ├─ 9. Route Handler (JWT verified where required)
    │       ├─ 10. Controller Logic + DB Query
    │       └─ 11. Error Handler (formats all errors)
    ▼
MongoDB Atlas / Cloudinary / Stripe / Resend / Groq
```

```

### 3.3 Deployment Architecture

```
Developer Machine
    │
    ├─ git push → GitHub (main branch)
    │   │
    │   └─ Vercel auto-deploys frontend
    │
    └─ docker build → docker push → Docker Hub
            │
            └─ Render pulls image → redeploys backend
```

**Backend update flow:**
1. Make code changes locally
2. `docker build -t suntrix-backend-prod .` (inside `/backend`)
3. `docker tag suntrix-backend-prod muhammadtahirsundhu/suntrix-backend:latest`
4. `docker push muhammadtahirsundhu/suntrix-backend:latest`
5. In Render dashboard → **Manual Deploy** → deploy

**Frontend update flow:**
1. Make code changes locally
2. `git add . && git commit -m "message" && git push origin main`
3. Vercel automatically detects push and redeploys (3–5 minutes)

---

## 4. Core Modules & Features

### 4.1 Authentication Module

**Purpose:** Secure admin login using JWT tokens with refresh token support.

**How it works:**
- Admin submits email/password via `POST /v1/auth/login`
- Server verifies bcrypt password hash
- Returns access token (configurable expiry, default 7 days) + refresh token (30 days)
- All admin-protected routes require `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
- Refresh token endpoint (`POST /v1/auth/refresh`) issues new token pair
- Logout endpoint acknowledges logout (tokens are stateless; client discards them)

**Roles:** `admin` (full access) | `viewer` (read-only, limited access)

**Token invalidation:** Changing `JWT_SECRET` in Settings → Security logs out all sessions immediately.

---

### 4.2 CMS Module

**Purpose:** Dynamic website content management — eliminates the need to redeploy frontend to update website text, images, or announcements.

**How it works:** All CMS content is stored as flexible key-value documents in the `CmsContent` MongoDB collection. The frontend fetches content keys on page load. The admin updates these via the Admin → Content panel.

**CMS Keys in use:**
| Key | Description |
|---|---|
| `hero` | Homepage hero section (headline, subheadline, CTA, background image) |
| `company` | Company info (name, tagline, description, CEO details, founding year) |
| `announcement` | Floating announcement bar (text, link, visibility toggle) |
| `social_links` | Social media URLs (LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub, etc.) |
| `seo_home` | SEO metadata for the homepage |

---

### 4.3 Portfolio & Case Studies Module

**Purpose:** Showcase completed client work on the public `/work` and `/work/:slug` pages.

**Features:**
- Rich media support (images or video per project)
- Tagging, categorization, featured flag
- SEO-friendly slugs
- Client logo, industry, measurable metric (e.g. "98% detection accuracy")
- Tool badges (tech stack per project)
- Highlight bullet points
- Draft/Published workflow with scheduled publish dates
- Drag-and-drop ordering in admin

**AI Extraction:** Admin can paste a project description and AI auto-fills all fields.

---

### 4.4 Blog / Posts Module

**Purpose:** SEO-driven blog to attract inbound traffic and demonstrate expertise.

**Features:**
- Rich HTML content (WYSIWYG via admin panel)
- Status: `draft` | `published` | `scheduled`
- Auto-publish on scheduled date (runs every 5 minutes via scheduler)
- Tags, categories, read time estimate
- Media attachments (images, videos, documents)
- View counter (incremented on public fetch)
- Featured post flag

---

### 4.5 Services / Departments Module

**Purpose:** Describes the agency's service lines on the public `/services/*` pages.

**Fields per department:**
- Name, subtitle, description, icon (Lucide icon name)
- URL slug (`href`)
- Capabilities list (6 bullet points)
- Tech stack array
- Use cases (4 items: title + description)
- Process steps (4 items: step number, title, description)
- Case study snippet (title, metric, description)
- Enabled/disabled toggle

**AI Extraction:** Admin can paste a service description and AI generates use cases, process steps, and case study in a single call.

---

### 4.6 Pricing Plans Module

**Purpose:** Dynamic pricing page (`/pricing`) where plans are managed from the admin panel.

**Key behavior:** When a visitor clicks "Get Started" on a pricing plan, they are redirected to `/request-task?plan=<planName>&budget=<price>`. These URL params are pre-filled in the task request form. The admin can then see which plan the client selected in the task request inbox.

**Fields:**
- Name, price, currency, billing period
- Description, feature list
- CTA button label and link
- `isPopular` flag (badge)
- `isVisible` toggle
- Ordering (drag-and-drop)

---

### 4.7 Team & Testimonials Module

**Team:** Manages the "Meet the Team" section on the About page.
- Name, role, department, bio
- Social links: LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub, website
- Photo URL, visibility toggle, ordering

**Testimonials:** Client review cards shown on homepage and `/testimonials` page.
- Quote, author name, role, company
- Avatar image, star rating (1–5)
- Status: `draft` | `published`
- Featured flag (shown on homepage)

---

### 4.8 Contact & Lead Capture Module

**Purpose:** Captures website visitor messages via the contact form at `/contact`.

**Flow:**
1. Visitor fills form → `POST /v1/contact`
2. Message saved to `ContactMessage` collection
3. Email notification sent to admin email (if `EMAIL_CONTACT_NOTIFICATIONS=true`)
4. Admin reads/manages messages in Admin → Messages

**Rate limit:** 20 submissions per IP per hour.

---

### 4.9 Newsletter Module

**Purpose:** Email subscriber list management and broadcast campaigns.

**Subscriber Flow:**
1. Visitor enters name/email in newsletter widget
2. Saved to `Newsletter` collection (unique by email)
3. Admin views all subscribers in Admin → Newsletter
4. Admin can broadcast emails to all/filtered subscribers

**Campaign Broadcast:**
1. Admin writes subject + HTML body (or uses AI to generate it)
2. Clicks "Send Broadcast"
3. Backend sends via Resend in configurable batches (default 100 emails/batch)
4. Campaign is recorded in `Campaign` collection for history

**Unsubscribe:** Admin can toggle `subscribed` field per subscriber.

---

### 4.10 Task Request Module

**Purpose:** The primary client intake form — captures all details needed to start a project. This is the starting point of the entire client lifecycle.

**Public form at `/request-task` captures:**
- Client info: name, email, phone, company, role
- Project info: title, service, budget, timeline, description, priority
- Technical info: tech stack, existing code, integration requirements
- Plan info: selected plan name + budget (auto-filled from pricing page)
- Notes / additional requirements

**After submission:**
- Tracking token generated (random 40-char hex)
- Task saved with status `new`
- Admin email notification sent
- Client can track status at `/track/:token`

**Task statuses (in order):**
```
new → in_review → proposal_sent → contract_sent → contract_signed → in_progress → completed
                                                                   ↘ cancelled
```

Each status change is recorded in `statusHistory` with a timestamp and note.

---

### 4.11 Proposal Module (AI-Assisted)

**Purpose:** Admin creates and sends professional project proposals to clients.

**Admin Workflow:**
1. Admin opens a task request in Admin → Tasks
2. Clicks **"Generate with AI"** → Groq LLM drafts a complete Statement of Work
3. Admin reviews, edits the 9-section SOW form + milestone breakdown
4. Clicks **"Create & Send Proposal"**
5. Proposal saved with unique `proposalToken` and 14-day expiry
6. Client receives email with proposal link

**Client Proposal Page (`/proposal/:token`):**
- Views full proposal with milestones, timeline, scope
- Can **Accept** → triggers AI contract generation + email
- Can **Request Changes** → admin notified, task returns to `in_review`

**Proposal statuses:** `draft` | `sent` | `accepted` | `changes_requested` | `rejected`

**Proposal sections (SOW):**
- Executive Summary, Scope of Work, Deliverables
- Timeline, Milestones (with amounts in cents stored, displayed in USD)
- Pricing Breakdown, Revisions Policy
- Client Responsibilities, Support & Warranty
- Payment Terms, Next Steps

---

### 4.12 Contract Module (AI-Generated + Digital Signing)

**Purpose:** When a client accepts a proposal, an AI-generated legal contract is sent. The client signs it digitally by typing their full name.

**Automatic trigger:** When client clicks "Accept Proposal" at `/proposal/:token`, the system:
1. Calls Groq LLM to generate a full legal service agreement in plain text
2. Creates a `Contract` document with 30-day expiry
3. Updates `TaskRequest.status` to `contract_sent`
4. Emails client the contract link

**Client Contract Page (`/contract/:token`):**
- Client reads the AI-generated contract
- Types their full legal name in the signature field
- Clicks "I Agree & Sign"

**On signing:**
1. Contract marked `signed`, captures IP address + user agent (legal evidence)
2. `TaskRequest.status` → `contract_signed`
3. `ProjectTracker` automatically created (idempotent — safe to retry)
4. Admin receives email notification
5. A `.docx` Word document is generated with the signed contract + digital signature record
6. Word document emailed to **both the client and the admin**

---

### 4.13 Payment Module (Stripe Integration)

**Purpose:** Secure payment collection via Stripe Checkout for project milestones.

**Payment types:**
- `invoice` — linked to a specific task request/project milestone
- `retainer` — standalone ad-hoc payment link
- `subscription` — (type available, not fully activated)

**Invoice Creation Flow (Admin):**
1. Admin opens Admin → Payments → "Create Invoice"
2. Enters client email, amount, description, optional task ID
3. **Important:** Invoice can only be created after `contract_signed` or `in_progress` status
4. System creates `Payment` record with unique `invoiceToken`
5. Invoice email sent to client with secure payment link

**Client Invoice Page (`/invoice/:token`):**
1. Client opens link
2. Backend creates a Stripe Checkout Session dynamically
3. Client pays via Stripe's hosted checkout
4. On success: redirected to `/track/:trackingToken?paid=1`

**Stripe Webhook (`POST /v1/payments/webhook`):**
Handles these events:
- `checkout.session.completed` → marks payment as `paid`, updates TaskRequest status to `in_progress`, sends confirmation email
- `checkout.session.completed` (type: `tracker_milestone`) → marks milestone as paid in ProjectTracker
- `payment_intent.payment_failed` → marks payment as `failed`
- `charge.refunded` → marks payment as `refunded`

**Note:** The Stripe webhook endpoint MUST use a raw body parser (bypasses `express.json()`). This is handled in `app.ts` before the body parser middleware.

**Admin payment tools:**
- `/admin/list` — paginated payment history with filters
- `/admin/stats` — total revenue, pending count, refunds, this-month revenue
- `/admin/create-invoice` — create task-linked invoice
- `/admin/create-payment-link` — standalone retainer/ad-hoc link
- `/admin/refund/:id` — issue partial or full Stripe refund

---

### 4.14 Project Tracker Module

**Purpose:** Real-time project management portal. After contract signing, both admin and client access the same project through different views.

**The ProjectTracker document is the single source of truth for an active project.** It stores everything: phases, deliverables, milestones, file attachments, chat messages, and a full audit log.

**Project Phases (in order):**
`Discovery` → `Design` → `Development` → `Testing` → `Delivery`

**Key sub-entities:**

| Sub-entity | Who Manages | Who Acts |
|---|---|---|
| Phases | Admin advances | — |
| Deliverables | Admin marks InReview | Client approves/rejects |
| Milestones | Admin marks payable | Client pays via Stripe |
| Updates | Admin posts | Client acknowledges |
| Files | Admin uploads | Client approves/rejects |
| Messages | Both send | Both read |
| Audit Log | System writes | Admin reads |

**Project Completion Flow:**
1. Admin clicks "Request Completion Sign-off"
2. Client receives email with link to portal
3. Client clicks "Approve & Complete Project"
4. `TaskRequest.status` → `completed`
5. Admin receives final notification email

---

### 4.15 Clients Module

**Purpose:** Manages the "Trusted Clients" logo strip shown on the homepage.

**Fields:** Company name, logo URL, website URL, visibility toggle, ordering.

Not to be confused with "clients" as in people — this is for displaying client brand logos publicly.

---

### 4.16 Media Library (Cloudinary)

**Purpose:** Centralized file upload and deduplication system.

**How uploads work:**
1. File is received by `POST /v1/upload` (multer in-memory)
2. MD5 hash of file buffer is computed
3. If hash already exists in `MediaAsset` collection → return existing Cloudinary URL (no re-upload)
4. If new → upload to Cloudinary → save to `MediaAsset` → return URL

**Supported resource types:**
- Images: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.webp`, `.svg` → uploaded as `image` type
- Documents: `.pdf`, `.doc`, `.docx`, etc. → uploaded as `raw` type

**Storage structure:** Files organized into `suntrix/` folder by default (configurable via `UPLOAD_DEFAULT_FOLDER` setting).

---

### 4.17 AI Chat Module (Groq)

**Purpose:** Public AI chatbot widget on the website homepage that answers visitor questions about services, pricing, and portfolio.

**How it works:**
1. Frontend sends chat history to `POST /v1/chat`
2. Backend builds system prompt dynamically from brand settings
3. Calls Groq with `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` model
4. Returns AI-generated response

**System prompt is built dynamically from:**
- `CHATBOT_NAME` — the bot's display name
- `BRAND_NAME`, `BRAND_EMAIL` — brand identity
- `CHATBOT_MAX_WORDS` — word limit
- `CHATBOT_PRICING_LINK`, `CHATBOT_PORTFOLIO_LINK`, `CHATBOT_CONTACT_LINK` — navigation hints
- `BRAND_RESPONSE_TIME`, `BRAND_PROPOSAL_GUARANTEE` — marketing claims

**Admin override:** If `CHATBOT_SYSTEM_PROMPT` is set to a non-empty string (>50 chars), it completely replaces the auto-generated prompt.

**Rate limit:** 30 requests per minute per IP.
**Master toggle:** `AI_ENABLED = false` disables all AI endpoints.

---

### 4.18 Notifications System

The platform has no in-app notification bell. All notifications are delivered via email (Resend). See [Section 10](#10-email--notification-system) for all email templates and their triggers.

---

### 4.19 Audit Log Module

**Purpose:** Immutable, searchable record of all admin actions for accountability and debugging.

**Actions tracked:**
`create` | `update` | `delete` | `publish` | `login` | `bulk_delete` | `bulk_update` | `status_change` | `broadcast` | `reorder` | `bulk_import`

**Fields per entry:** action, entity type, entity ID, entity name, admin ID, admin name, before/after diff.

**Retention:** Configurable via `AUDIT_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS` setting. Cleaned up daily at 2 AM by the scheduler.

---

### 4.20 System Settings Module

**Purpose:** Runtime configuration of all platform settings without redeploying. Admins update API keys, brand info, and toggles via the Admin → Settings panel.

**Settings hierarchy (priority order):**
1. DB value (highest priority — set via Admin UI)
2. `.env` file value (fallback if DB value is empty)
3. Hardcoded default in `configLoader.ts` (last resort)

**Setting sections:**
| Section | Keys |
|---|---|
| `ai` | GROQ_API_KEY, GROQ_CHAT_MODEL, GROQ_EXTRACT_MODEL, temperatures, max tokens, AI_ENABLED |
| `email` | RESEND_API_KEY, ADMIN_EMAIL, FROM_EMAIL_NAME, FROM_EMAIL_ADDRESS, FRONTEND_URL, notification toggles |
| `payment` | STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY, STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET, STRIPE_MODE, PAYMENT_CURRENCY, INVOICE_VALIDITY_DAYS |
| `storage` | CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME, CLOUDINARY_API_KEY, CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET, UPLOAD_MAX_SIZE_MB, UPLOAD_DEFAULT_FOLDER |
| `brand` | BRAND_NAME, BRAND_TAGLINE, BRAND_EMAIL, BRAND_WEBSITE, BRAND_RESPONSE_TIME, BRAND_PROPOSAL_GUARANTEE |
| `chatbot` | CHATBOT_ENABLED, CHATBOT_NAME, CHATBOT_WELCOME_MESSAGE, CHATBOT_SYSTEM_PROMPT, CHATBOT_MAX_WORDS, link settings |
| `newsletter` | NEWSLETTER_BATCH_SIZE, NEWSLETTER_FOOTER_TEXT, NEWSLETTER_DOUBLE_OPTIN |
| `security` | JWT_SECRET, JWT_EXPIRY, MAINTENANCE_MODE, RATE_LIMIT_MAX, AUDIT_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS |

**Setting types:** `text` | `password` (masked) | `toggle` (boolean) | `number` | `textarea` | `url` | `select` (dropdown)

## 8. Authentication & Security

### 8.1 JWT Strategy

- **Algorithm:** HS256
- **Access token expiry:** Configurable via `JWT_EXPIRY` setting (default: `7d`)
- **Refresh token expiry:** 30 days (hardcoded)
- **Refresh secret:** `JWT_SECRET + "_refresh_token_salt"` (derived, not stored separately)
- **Payload:** `{ id, email, role, name }`
- **Invalidation:** Changing `JWT_SECRET` in settings invalidates ALL existing tokens

**Middleware (`requireAuth`):**
```typescript
// Checks Authorization: Bearer <token> header
// Verifies signature + expiry
// Attaches decoded user to req.user
```

### 8.2 Rate Limiting

Three separate limiters:

| Limiter | Window | Max Requests | Applied To |
|---|---|---|---|
| Global | 15 minutes | 500 (configurable) | All routes |
| Form | 1 hour | 20 POST requests | `/task-requests`, `/contact`, `/newsletter` |
| Chat | 1 minute | 30 requests | `/chat` |

The global limit reads `RATE_LIMIT_MAX` from `configLoader` dynamically on each request — admin can change it without restart.

### 8.3 CORS Policy

Allowed origins (whitelist):
1. `process.env.FRONTEND_URL` (set in Render environment variables)
2. `http://localhost:5173` (always allowed)
3. `http://localhost:3000` (always allowed)

All other origins receive a CORS error. Requests with no `Origin` header (Postman, curl, mobile) are always allowed.

### 8.4 Additional Security

| Layer | What it does |
|---|---|
| `helmet` | Sets 14 HTTP security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame, etc.) |
| `express-mongo-sanitize` | Strips `$` and `.` from req.body, query, params to prevent NoSQL injection |
| `bcryptjs` (cost 12) | One-way password hashing |
| Maintenance Mode | Returns 503 for all public routes when `MAINTENANCE_MODE=true` |
| Admin bypass | Admin routes, `/health`, and authenticated requests bypass maintenance mode |

## 11. Third-Party Integrations

### 11.1 Stripe

**Purpose:** All payment processing.

**Setup:**
1. Create Stripe account at dashboard.stripe.com
2. Get Secret Key (`sk_test_...` or `sk_live_...`)
3. Create Webhook endpoint pointing to `https://your-backend/v1/payments/webhook`
4. Select events: `checkout.session.completed`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`, `charge.refunded`
5. Copy Webhook Secret (`whsec_...`)
6. Add all three to Settings → Payment in Admin panel

**Key behaviors:**
- Always uses Stripe Checkout (hosted page) — never custom card form

---

### 11.2 Cloudinary

**Purpose:** All file uploads and media storage.

**Setup:**
1. Create Cloudinary account at cloudinary.com
2. From Dashboard, copy: Cloud Name, API Key, API Secret
3. Add to Settings → Storage in Admin panel

**Upload deduplication:** The platform MD5-hashes every file before uploading. If the same file has been uploaded before (in any folder), the existing Cloudinary URL is returned instantly.

**Upload limits:** Configurable via `UPLOAD_MAX_SIZE_MB` (default 50MB).

---

### 11.3 Resend

**Purpose:** All transactional and broadcast emails.

**Setup:**
1. Create account at resend.com
2. Verify your sender domain (or use `onboarding@resend.dev` for testing)

**Purpose:** AI features — chatbot, proposal drafting, contract generation, field extraction, email template generation.

**Setup:**
1. Create account at console.groq.com
2. Create API key (`gsk_...`)
3. Add to Settings → AI in Admin panel

**Models used:**
| Task | Default Model |

## 12. Deployment Guide

### 12.1 Backend — Docker + Render

**Build process (multi-stage Docker):**

```
Stage 1 (Builder):
  node:20-alpine
  npm install (all dependencies)
  tsc (TypeScript → JavaScript in /dist)

Stage 2 (Production):
  node:20-alpine (fresh, minimal)
  USER node (non-root security)
  npm install --omit=dev (production only)
  COPY /dist from builder
  EXPOSE 4000
  CMD ["node", "dist/app.js"]
```

**Deploy new version:**
```bash
cd backend
docker build -t suntrix-backend-prod .
docker tag suntrix-backend-prod muhammadtahirsundhu/suntrix-backend:latest
docker push muhammadtahirsundhu/suntrix-backend:latest
```
Then in Render: **Manual Deploy** → pull latest image.

**Render Environment Variables to set:**
```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=4000
MONGODB_URI=<your Atlas connection string>
FRONTEND_URL=https://suntrixai.vercel.app
JWT_SECRET=<strong 64+ char secret>
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=<your cloud name>
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=<your api key>
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=<your api secret>
GROQ_API_KEY=<your groq key>
RESEND_API_KEY=<your resend key>
ADMIN_EMAIL=<admin email for notifications>
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=<sk_live_...>
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<whsec_...>
```

---

### 12.2 Frontend — Vercel

**How deployment works:**
- Connected to GitHub repository (main branch)
- Any push to `main` triggers automatic rebuild and deploy
- Build command: `vite build`
- Output directory: `dist`

**SPA Routing:** A `vercel.json` file at the project root ensures all routes serve `index.html` (required for React Router):
```json
{
  "rewrites": [{ "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }]
}
```

**Vercel Environment Variables to set:**
```
VITE_API_URL=https://suntrix-backend.onrender.com/v1
```

## 13. Background Jobs & Scheduler

The scheduler starts automatically when the backend boots (`startScheduler()` called in `start()`).

### Job 1: Auto-Publish Scheduled Content
- **Schedule:** Every 5 minutes (`*/5 * * * *`)
- **What it does:**
  - Queries all `Post` documents with `status: "scheduled"` and `publishAt <= now()`
  - Sets them to `status: "published"`, records `publishedAt`
  - Queries all `Portfolio` documents with `status: "draft"` and `publishAt <= now()`
  - Sets them to `status: "published"`

### Job 2: Audit Log Retention Cleanup
- **Schedule:** Daily at 2:00 AM (`0 2 * * *`)
- **What it does:**
  - Reads `AUDIT_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS` from settings (default: 90)
  - Deletes all `AuditLog` entries older than that cutoff date
  - If retention days = 0, keeps all logs forever

---

## 14. Troubleshooting & FAQ

### Q: Admin login returns 401

**Cause:** Wrong email/password, or admin account doesn't exist.  
**Fix:** Create admin account directly in MongoDB or via the ts-node script in Section 2.4.

---

### Q: CORS error on frontend

**Cause:** `FRONTEND_URL` environment variable on Render doesn't match your Vercel URL.  
**Fix:** In Render → Environment → Set `FRONTEND_URL=https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app`

---

### Q: Stripe webhook not working

**Cause:** Webhook secret mismatch, or wrong URL configured in Stripe dashboard.  
**Fix:** Ensure Stripe webhook URL is `https://your-backend/v1/payments/webhook` and the `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` matches exactly.

---

### Q: Email not sending

**Cause:** `RESEND_API_KEY` not set, or `FROM_EMAIL_ADDRESS` is not a verified Resend sender.  
**Fix:** Set API key in Admin → Settings → Email. Verify your domain or use `onboarding@resend.dev` for testing.

---

### Q: AI features not working

**Cause:** `GROQ_API_KEY` not configured, expired, or `AI_ENABLED` is set to false.  
**Fix:** Check Admin → Settings → AI. Verify key at console.groq.com.

---

### Q: File uploads fail

**Cause:** Cloudinary credentials not set, or file exceeds size limit.  
**Fix:** Check Admin → Settings → Storage. Verify all 3 Cloudinary credentials.

---

### Q: Docker push says "nothing changed"

**Cause:** You pushed without rebuilding the Docker image first.  
**Fix:** Always run `docker build` before `docker push`. The push only uploads what was built.

---

### Q: /admin page shows 404 on Vercel

**Cause:** Missing `vercel.json` with SPA rewrite rule.  
**Fix:** Ensure `vercel.json` exists at project root with the rewrite config from Section 12.2.

---

### Q: Settings changed in admin but not taking effect

**Cause:** In extreme cases, the in-memory cache may need a reset.  
**Fix:** In Render, trigger a manual deploy — the server restarts and reloads all settings from DB on boot.

---
